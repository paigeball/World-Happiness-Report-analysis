# World Happiness Report Analysis
This is a GitHub repository that I will use to store a new R project on exploratory data analysis.
The source for the project idea is from *[Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/data-analytics-portfolio-project-ideas/#exploratory-data-analysis-project-ideas)*.
It involves collecting, processing, analyzing, and predicting World Happiness Report data.

## Data
